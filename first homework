A-Define a list that contain the names of graduated students” 5 students at least”:
       Create a program that accept student name and prints if the user is graduated or not.

gl=[]
for i in range (0,10):
    name = input('enter your name : ')
    gg = int(input('enter your graduation grade : '))
    if gg >= 60:
        gl.append(name)
        print(gl)
B- Generate and print a list of odd numbers from 1 to 1000.
     Tips: “List Comprehension”
lista=[]
for i in range (1,1000):
    if i%2 !=0 :
        lista.append(i)
print(lista)
C- L=[‘Network’ , ’Math’ , ’Programming’, ‘Physics’ , ‘Music’]

        In this exercise, you will implement a Python program that reads the items of the previous list and identifies 
        the items that starts with ‘P’ letter, then print it on screen.
     Tips: using loop, list ‘len ()’ method
lista = [ 'math' , 'network' , 'programming', 'physics','music']
l=[]
i = 0
while i<5 :

if lista[i][0]=='p':
l.append(lista[i])
i+=1
if i == 5:
break
print(l)
D: Using Dictionary comprehension, Generate this dictionary d={1:1,2:4,3:9,4:16,5:25,6:36,7:42,8:64,9:81,10:100} 

lista={}
i=1 
while i<11:
 a=i
 b=i*i
 lista.setdefault(a,b)
 i+=1
 if i==11:
  break
print(lista)
Question 2: Convert from decimal to binary
  Write a Python program that converts a decimal number into its equivalent binary number.
The program should start reading the decimal number from the user. Then the binary equivalent number must be calculated. Finally, the program must display the equivalent binary number on the screen.
Tips: use empty list to hold binary number, use loop, use % operator, use // operator, use list append method, reverse the list.
num = int(input('enter the number'))
num = int(input('enter the number'))
s = 0
a =[]
while(num!=0):
    s=num%2
    num=num//2
    a.append(s)
for i in range(0,1):
    a.reverse()
print(a,sep='&&')
  Question 3: Working with Files” Quiz Program”
 Type python quiz program that takes a text or json or csv file as input for (20 (Questions, Answers)). It asks the questions and finally computes and prints user results and store user name and result in separate file.
import json
